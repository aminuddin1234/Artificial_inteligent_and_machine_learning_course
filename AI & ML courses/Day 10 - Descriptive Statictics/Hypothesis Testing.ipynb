    "Type I Error: Occurs when the null hypothesis is rejected when it is actually true, leading to a false positive. The probability of this error is denoted as alpha (α), typically set at 0.05.\n",

    "# Simple example\n",
    "In simple terms, a one-sample hypothesis test is like a detective trying to figure out if a certain claim about a group is true. For example, imagine a bakery claims that their average cookie baking time is 15 minutes. To check this, you take a random sample of cookies and measure how long they actually took to bake. You then compare this sample average to the claimed average of 15 minutes. If your sample shows a significant difference, you might conclude that the bakery's claim isn't accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make this decision, you set up two statements: the null hypothesis (which assumes the claim is true) and the alternative hypothesis (which suggests it might not be true). You then calculate a p-value, which tells you how likely it is to see the difference you found if the null hypothesis were true. If this p-value is very small (like less than 5%), you can confidently say that the bakery's claim is likely incorrect."
