    "Context: Imagine you are a data analyst at a company that manufactures home appliances. Your company has recently launched a new refrigerator model with innovative digital features, and you need to assess customer satisfaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1: Identify the Target Population\n",
    "You define your target population as the 10,000 customers who purchased this specific refrigerator model. This ensures that your survey focuses on the right group of people who have experience with the product.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 2: Select the Sampling Frame\n",
    "You create a sampling frame, which is a list of all the customers who bought the refrigerator. This list might come from the company’s sales database, but it may not be perfect due to missing or outdated contact information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 3: Choose the Sampling Method\n",
    "You decide to use a probability sampling method, such as simple random sampling, to ensure that every customer has an equal chance of being selected for the survey. This helps to minimize bias and makes your results more reliable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 4: Determine the Sample Size\n",
    "After considering your resources and the need for accurate results, you decide to survey 500 customers. This sample size is large enough to provide meaningful insights while being manageable within your budget and timeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 5: Collect the Sample Data\n",
    "You distribute the customer satisfaction survey to the selected 500 customers. The responses will give you valuable data on how customers feel about the digital features of the refrigerator, which you can then analyze and present to stakeholders."

    "- Application of the Theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "    - For example, to estimate the average height of university students, a large enough sample can provide a mean that approximates the population mean.\n",

    "- Practical Example\n",
    "\n",
    "    - In studying coffee consumption, repeated random samples can be taken to estimate the average amount consumed per day.\n",
