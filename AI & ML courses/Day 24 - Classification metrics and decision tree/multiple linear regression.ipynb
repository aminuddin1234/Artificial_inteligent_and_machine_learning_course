    "- *Sales Forecasting:*\n",
    "\n",
    "- Scenario: A retail company wants to predict monthly sales.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Independent Variables: Factors such as advertising spend, number of promotions, seasonality (e.g., holidays), and website traffic.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Application: By using multiple regression, the company can determine how each of these factors contributes to sales. This helps in optimizing marketing strategies and budget allocation.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Scenario: A service-based company aims to understand what influences customer satisfaction scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Independent Variables: Variables like response time, service quality, pricing, and customer support interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Application: Multiple regression can reveal which factors most significantly affect customer satisfaction. This insight allows the company to focus on improving specific areas to enhance overall customer experience."

    "- Assumptions of Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Linearity: Each predictor variable (X_i) should have a linear relationship with the outcome variable (Y). Scatter plots can help identify these relationships.\n",
    "    - Independent Observations: Each observation in the dataset must be independent. This can be checked by examining the data collection process.\n",

    "- Additional Assumptions for Multiple Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Normality: The residuals (errors) should be normally distributed.\n",
    "    - Homoscedasticity: The variation of residuals should be constant across the model.\n",
    "    - No Multicollinearity: Independent variables (X_i and X_j) should not be highly correlated. This can be assessed using scatter plots and Variance Inflation Factor (VIF).\n",

    "\n",
    "    - EDA is crucial for understanding relationships between variables. Scatter plot matrices can visualize relationships, while VIF quantifies multicollinearity.\n",
    "    - If multicollinearity is detected, solutions include dropping variables or creating new ones."
