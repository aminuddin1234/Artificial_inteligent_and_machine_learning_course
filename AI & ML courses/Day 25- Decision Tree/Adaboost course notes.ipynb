    "Boosting Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "- Boosting is a supervised learning technique that creates an ensemble of weak learners sequentially, with each learner correcting the errors of its predecessor.\n",
    "- Unlike random forest, which builds models in parallel, boosting builds them sequentially, allowing each new learner to focus on the mistakes made by the previous one.\n",
    "\n",
    "AdaBoost Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "- AdaBoost is a specific boosting method where each base learner assigns greater weight to observations that were misclassified by the previous learner.\n",
    "- The process continues until a perfect prediction is made or a specified maximum number of trees is reached, with the final predictions aggregated through a voting process for classification or a weighted mean for regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages and Disadvantages\n",
    "\n",
    "- Boosting reduces bias and is robust to outliers, making it effective for various data types without requiring scaling or normalization.\n",
    "- However, it does not scale well for very large datasets due to its sequential nature, which can limit computational efficiency compared to other methods like bagging."

    "Learner Type:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Boosting: Typically uses weak learners, which are models that perform slightly better than random guessing. The focus is on improving the overall model by combining these weak learners.\n",

    "\n",
    "Error Correction:\n",
    "- Boosting: Each model in the sequence is trained to correct the errors of the previous models, leading to a focus on difficult-to-predict instances.\n",
